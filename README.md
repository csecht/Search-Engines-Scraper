# Search Aggregator
Aggregates results from several search engines with output to Terminal and text file. This is a fork of Search Engines Scraper by tasos_py, but is run from the `aggregate_search.py` Python script.
## Supported search engines  

- _[Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com)_
- _[Startpage](https://www.startpage.com)_
- _[Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com)_

## Features
 - Uses search engines that are focused on user privacy.
 - Non-redundant results (URL, page title, page detail) are printed to the Terminal/console with easy-to-read colors and to an automatically named text file.
 - A random user agent is assigned from an appropriate set of options for each engine.

## Requirements
_Python 3_ with
_[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)_ and
_[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)_ 

Developed in Python 3.8-3.9

## Installation
Download the .zip code archive, extract the .zip file, open Terminal/Command Prompt in the search-aggregator-main folder, run the setup file:

`python3 setup.py install`

Done!

## Usage  
From within the search-aggregator-main folder, execute `aggregate_search.py` from Terminal/Command Prompt:
- Linux/MacOS: `python3 aggregate_search.py` or `./aggregate_search.py`
- Windows: `python3 aggregate_search.py` or `python aggregate_search.py` or `py aggregate_search.py`, depending on your system environment. 

then enter your search term at the prompt. Example output:
```
Enter search term: gov forest policy

...and all remaining results. All results are printed to Terminal and written to a file automatically titled: Results_gov+forest+policies.txt

Example of color-enhanced Terminal output:
![color_output](images/scrnshot_output.png)

ARGUMENTS: --help, --info, --use, or --x. 

The command `aggregate_search.py --use` provides examples of search term syntax, then exits.

The command `aggregate_search.py --x 2` doubles the number of results returned; `--x 3` triples results, etc., up to `--x 5`. Without an --x argument, ~60 -- 80 total unique results are returned. 

### Single engine search
The original command line client from Search-Engines-Scraper, `search_engines_cli.py` can be used for customized searches. For example, 
```
python3 search_engines_cli.py -q forestry -p 4 -e mojeek
```
will return four pages of url results for the query 'forestry' from the Mojeek engine. If no -e engine is specified, defaults to DuckDuckGo. To see additional search and output options, use the help command,
```
python3 search_engines_cli.py -h
```
## Known issues
As of July 2022, MetaGer searches return no results because scrapper queries
now require a CAPTCHA response, which aggregate_search.py does not provide.
