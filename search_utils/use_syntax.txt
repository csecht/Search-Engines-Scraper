Specifiers like site:edu, 'dogs AND cats', or 'dogs -cats' may not work as expected, specifically with Startpage.
Example search terms:
    paint => Results prefer 'paint', but also finds 'Paints', 'painter', 'painting', etc.
    "jump the shark" => Double quote a word or phrase for exact matches.
    jump AND shark => Any combination of 'jump(s)' with 'shark(s)'.
    classes edu => Preference for 'classes' at .edu sites.
    site:gov subsidy => Search only .gov domains. For Startpage try 'gov subsidy'.
    dogs cats => Preference for 'dogs' with 'cats', but also only 'dogs', 'cats', 'dog', etc.
    *ology => Wildcard character * will prefer 'ology'; does not find 'biology', 'ecology', etc.
    Rock * roll -and => 'Rock -N- Roll', 'rock & roll', etc. (excludes 'and')
Results are printed to the Terminal and written to the ResultsFiles folder.
